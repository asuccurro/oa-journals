**From paying for reading to paying for publishing: To whom, and for whom are Open Access scientific articles accessible?**

Universal access to scientific knowledge is the core principle of Open Science and, considering
scientific publishing, of Open Access. Scientific publishers implemented Open Access options
shifting the cost of accessing scientific articles from readers to authors. A critical question arises:
does reallocating the cost of publishing create a new form of inequality across the scientific
community? We investigate the potential financial barriers associated with the cost of publishing,
considering differences between disciplines, geographic locations, organizations, and scholarly
backgrounds. We highlight possible threats to the so-called ‘Golden Road to Open Access’ that
might constitute paradoxical forms of inaccessibility and exclusion.

The data are downloaded from Web of Science.
